                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health and Poverty Levels</h2>
                    <p>We examined the outcome (for state-level data) of obesity, smoking, and uninsured (healthcare) percentages
                        based on three factors, poverty level (percentage below poverty line), median age, and median household income.
                        We found a positive correlation between poverty levels and levels of unisured individuals. We see similar correlations 
                        with obesity and smoking levels. Conversely, we see negative correlations between all three outcomes and median household income.
                        This tracks with the poverty correlations, as in general, we expect the poverty percentage to decrease as median household income increases.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>.With median age, we see some less obvious correlations.  There might be a weak negative correlation
                        between median age and the uninsured percentage of the population.  This might be due to the presence of Medicare for older individuals.
                        However, full conclusions would require quantification of any correlation.  Meanwhile, the smoking percentage shows a positive correlation,
                        as older populations appear to smoke more.  This would seem to correlate well with general knowledge, as accepatance of smoking in public has changed
                        over times.  For example, while people used to smoke in airplanes, many states now ban smoking in any public place, including bars.  Finally,
                        we see no visible correlation between median age and obesity rates.

                    <p>
                        This data was based off of data taken in 2014 from <a href = "https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">U. S. Census Data</a>.
                        However, one possible variable is that the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Wikipedia</a>).
                        It would be interesting to see how this data has changed in the last few years.  One possible clue is that the lowest uninsured rate was in Massachussetts,
                        which implemented a similar program to the Affordable Care Act some years earlier (in fact, the Affordable Care Act takes many ideas from Massachussetts's program).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is interesting to note a few other extreme values.  Texas had by the highest uninsured rate.  It,
                        and Georgia, stand out, even accounting for income level.  In a different category, Utah has the lowest percentage of smokers
                        among all states.  There is perhaps, some truth to Utah's sterotype of Mormonism, and Mormon's stereotypical abstinnence from 
                        various substances such as caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco.  Admittedly, though, Utah is also the youngest state by median age,
                        and smoking percentage does tend to decrease with a younger population.
